It developed as a feature with a social purpose. Users can design their creations and sync them into the scooter dashboard. At the same time, they can also share their designs on social platforms.
The navigation function is the upgraded version for this dashboard. Therefore, there are a lot of restrictions and limitations to go over.
​
My mission was to create a good navigation experience for the user. This dashboard will show turn-by-turn instructions while routing when the Bluetooth-connected phone and scooter. The challenge is making information simple and letting riders reach it in safe. I manage the entire UX and UI design from beginning to end.</span></div><div class="v868_7488"><div class="v868_7485"><span class="v412_5422">Mission</span><span class="v412_5423">Add the navigation feature to the existed scooter dashboard.
The goal is to let the rider get to the next direction with a glance in one second.</span></div><div class="v413_5486"></div><div class="v868_7486"><span class="v412_5424">Challenge</span><span class="v412_5425">The navigation function is a crucial selling point for the vehicle. Unfortunately, it can not change the hardware due to the alpha version already being sold. I need to re-design this structure via software changes and build a navigation function into it.</span></div><div class="v413_5487"></div><div class="v868_7487"><span class="v412_5426">My Role</span><span class="v412_5427">I am responsible for the entire UX and UI design, from defining the problem to delivering the final product to go to market.

The file size should be small while transferring. From the marketing perspective, adding hardware in the new update is impossible.
On the firmware side, It has the original interaction structure in the first version. Considering the user experience will be harmful with a massive update. The navigation function should follow the original architecture.
On the app side, the app's information architecture is not proper for navigation usage. Therefore, we should build up another structure to put map purchase, route settings, and navigation.</span><span class="v420_5470">Finding</span><span class="v414_5522">Through discovering and brainstorming with the members, we got some possible directions to design the navigation. The limitations: it is a simple device, so the computing of the dashboard is not robust. It is impossible to show the navigation view that google Maps or portable car GPS navigation systems have.

The ideas in the following:</span><div class="v868_7532"><div class="v868_7533"><div class="name"></div><span class="v868_7534">Streetview Indicator: display the Streetview on-screen before 10 miles of the corner.</span></div><div class="v868_7535"><div class="name"></div><span class="v868_7537">Ring Indicator: display a ring as a count-down timer before the turn.</span></div><div class="v868_7538"><div class="name"></div><span class="v868_7540">Number Indicator: display the distance before the junction.</span></div><div class="v868_7541"><div class="name"></div><span class="v868_7543">Background Indicator 1: decrease the background color for the turning of time.</span></div><div class="v868_7544"><div class="name"></div><span class="v868_7546">Background Indicator 2: notify the user by changing the background color.</span></div></div></div><div class="v868_7556"></div><div class="v868_7558"><span class="v868_7559">Testing</span><span class="v868_7560">We were not sure which one is best for riders, therefore we made rapid prototypes to test if the tester can go to the defined destination thought out by not telling a word.
